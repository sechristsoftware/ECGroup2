                        The government has been talking about reduces these prices for a long time, but has it shown any progress? Recently Bernie Sanders issued a bill to reduce tuition costs. Under the plan, the Government would cover 67%, or 47 billions dollars of costs. However colleges will have to meet requirements to qualify for the grants, like ensuring universities maintain and increase expenditures on students each year.
                        <br /><br />
                        So how can students reduce these costs further? Students need to check online for the net price of College, to know what they should expect. It is also important to apply for FAFSA as well as scholarships to see if you can get support. Lastly, starting off at a community College and transferring is becoming a very popular option that reduces costs greatly.
                        <br /><br />
                        Also, these prices listed on the college sites are sometimes exaggerated, as most students don't pay the sticker price. Much of the sticker price is reduced by scholarships, financial aid, and other sources.
